# Cascaded Queuing System Simulation

This project simulates a cascaded M/M/1 queuing system with three sequential service stages (A, B, and C). Stage A includes two back-to-back services, while B and C follow with single-server queues. The system is analyzed under varying arrival and service rates to study queue behavior, response times, and performance limits.

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Overview

- **Queue Model**: Cascaded M/M/1 system  
- **Stages**:
  - **Stage A**: Two sequential exponential services (ŒºA1, ŒºA2)
  - **Stages B & C**: Single exponential services (ŒºB, ŒºC)
- **Arrival Process**: Poisson (Œª)
- **Tool**: MATLAB

## üß† Code Workflow

- `main.m`:  
  Initializes the simulation. Defines system parameters and coordinates calls to queue function modules for each stage.

- `Qx1.m`:  
  Simulates an M/M/1 queue with a Poisson arrival process and exponential service times.  
  **Inputs**: Mean arrival rate (Œª), mean service rate (Œº)  
  **Outputs**: Sojourn times, departure timestamps

- `Qx2.m`:  
  Modified M/M/1 simulation that uses actual inter-arrival intervals derived from the **departure times of the previous stage**, rather than generating arrivals from a Poisson process.  
  **Inputs**: Array of departure timestamps, mean service rate (Œº)  
  **Outputs**: Sojourn times, updated departures

- `acNhist2.m`:  
  Utility to plot the **envelope (histogram)** of distributions for response times or service rates from simulation output.
